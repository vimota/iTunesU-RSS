**		iTunes U RSS Feed Creator	   **
*****************************************
-By Victor Mota

This small ruby script dives into your iTunes U file directory and creates a
podcast/RSS feed out of the .M4V files there. It also moves the directory to
a webserver. Currently I use OSX's built in Apache Web Server in the Web 
Sharing service. However, you can modify this script to any desired web server
and even make it work for non iTunes U type videos.

TO MAKE IT WORK:
It's easy, update the constants to your desired Path's!

TO DO:
-make the moving/renaming of files faster/smarter by checking what already exists
-also make one RSS feed from all the other feeds so you don't have to add each one
-create some sort of web interface to run this upon request
	OR -create a scheduled task to run this and update the RSS feed/webserver
