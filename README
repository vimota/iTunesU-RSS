**        iTunes U RSS Feed Creator    **
*****************************************
-By Victor Mota

This small ruby script dives into your iTunes U file directory and creates a
podcast/RSS feed out of the .M4V files there. It also moves the directory to
a webserver. Currently I use OSX's built in Apache Web Server in the Web 
Sharing service. However, you can modify this script to any desired web server
and even make it work for non iTunes U type videos.



TO MAKE IT WORK:
-Update the constants to your desired paths
-Allow your Apache webserver to follow symlink by adding the following to your *user* 
or httpd.conf file under <Directory />:
	Options FollowSymLinks
-Then create a symlink from your webserver (eg. osx web sharing: /Library/WebServer/Documents)
to your iTunes U folder with the link being iTunesU
	cd *WEBSERVER PATH*
	sudo ln -s /Users/*USERNAME*/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/iTunes\ U  iTunesU



TO DO:
-also make one RSS feed from all the other feeds so you don't have to add each one
-create some sort of web interface to run this upon request
    OR -create a scheduled task to run this and update the RSS feed
